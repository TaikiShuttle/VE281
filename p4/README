Implement a shortest path problem considering:
1. May contain a negetive edge
2. May contain a negative loop

Some algorithms can be used:
1. Dijkstra (first add all edges to positive?)
2. Bellman-Ford (efficient for sparse graph but slow for dense graph)
3. Floyd (efficient for dense graph but slow for sparse graph)
4. FSPA (based on Bellman-Ford, uses a queue to optimize)

The testcases are all dense graphs, which makes Floyd a better choice.
